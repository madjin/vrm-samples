This section contains exported default assets from the VRoid Studio *male* creator.

Here you can find layer guides for everything in VRoid by default, as well as default textures.

These can be useful for creating custom assets, or bringing back the defaults if you accidentally messed something up!



Everything should be organised nicely - start with the area of VRoid you are working in (Face Editor, etc)

Then select the Folder matching to the area you wish to import to (Eyebrows, etc)

Then select style you want (Human, Android etc)

Then select your asset.





Got questions, need help, or an asset is broken?
